This is the learn to code site for Station082 and Capable Labs.
This is also the first place where contributors go to make their first commit. The first commit to add here is your name, and what is in your grandmother's suitcase. 
My name is Erynn, and in my grandmother's suitcase is an umbrella. 
My name is Delainey, and in my grandmother's suitcase is an oven.
